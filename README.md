# 🌱 Smart Plant Health Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Plant Health Monitoring Dashboard** is an IoT-powered real-time analytics system designed for efficient plant care. The system monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels and provides automated irrigation to ensure optimal plant health.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌡️ **Real-time monitoring** of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- 🔔 **Instant alerts** to prevent plant stress and diseases.
- 💧 **Automated irrigation** to prevent overwatering and dehydration.
- ☁️ **Cloud-based data insights** for remote monitoring.
- ⚙️ **User-friendly interface** with low maintenance requirements.
- 🌱 **Optimized resource usage** to minimize manual labor.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React
- **IoT Hardware:** Node MCU (ESP8266), Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT11, Water Pump
- **Cloud Services:** ThingSpeak for real-time data visualization

## 📡 How It Works
1. The **IoT sensors** collect environmental data.
2. The **ESP8266 (Node MCU)** processes the data and sends it to **ThingSpeak**.
3. The system **automatically triggers the water pump** when soil moisture levels drop.
4. Users can **monitor live data** through the dashboard.

## 📦 Components Used
- 🖥️ **Node MCU** (ESP8266)
- 💦 **Soil Moisture Sensor**
- 🌡️ **DHT11 Sensor** (Temperature & Humidity)
- 🔋 **Battery Module**
- 🔧 **Jumper Wires**
- 💧 **Water Pump**

## 🎯 Advantages
✔️ Real-time tracking for plant health.
✔️ Reduces water waste through optimized irrigation.
✔️ Provides remote monitoring and insights.
✔️ Enhances crop yield through data-driven decisions.
✔️ Requires minimal manual intervention.
